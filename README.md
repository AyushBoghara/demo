# SimpleSite

This is a minimal static website with a Home page and an About page.

Files added:

- `index.html` — Home page
- `about.html` — About page
- `styles.css` — Shared stylesheet

Preview locally (from the `demo` folder):

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

If you want, I can run a local preview for you or commit these files.
